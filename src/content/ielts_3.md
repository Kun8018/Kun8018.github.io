### 范文1

**标题: Personal Statement**

**开头: 表明自己对该专业的兴趣**

**来自于课程学习与文化交流经验**

My interest in Global China Studies stems from my undergraduate coursework and diverse cultural exchange experiences. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in International Politics and minored in French Language and Literature. Throughout my coursework, I participated in classes related to China studies, such as *Contemporary China and the World*, *Chinese Government and Politics*, and *Foreign Relations of PRC*, which sparked my interest in the politics and political economics of China's development.

**接下来具体,讲清你对专业的理解**

*每个段落之间设置段前间距与段后间距 用来理清层次,显得清晰**

For instance, the real estate industry was once regarded as a key driver of China's economic growth, creating jobs and attracting investment. This growth was undoubtedly supported by government policies. In 1994, China implemented a tax-sharing reform that separated central and local government taxation, ensuring stable central fiscal revenue while incentivizing local governments to increase their fiscal capacity. By leveraging land-use rights to attract investment and develop real estate, local governments not only secured fiscal revenue but also fostered regional economic development. Major cities in China have largely developed along this path. These observations clearly demonstrate the close connection between politics and economics, as economic development requires political support. This also prompted me to reflect on China's future political and economic policies, especially regarding how China can further its “Reform and Opening Up” policies.

**从身边人谈起: 两位外教老师对于某观点的激烈冲突**

**再现表明自己为何想要深入研究申请的专业领域**

Furthermore, my experiences with cultural exchange have broadened my perspectives on understanding China. In my French classes, I often discussed topics like China's economic development, domestic politics, and foreign relations with French teachers. Despite coming from a Western, or perhaps more accurately, a capitalist country (in the common sense of Chinese people), one of my French teachers had unique views on Chinese society, possibly due to his background as a member of the French Communist Party. During a dinner conversation, when a German teacher criticized the existence of personal cults in Chinese politics and questioned China's democratic progress, the French teacher fervently defended China's political development. He argued that to understand Chinese politics, one must first understand the country's history of decolonization, feudalism, and reform, and consider the political ideologies of its leaders, from Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping. The stark disagreement between the French and German teachers on China's political development (essentially a debate between Marxist and Western liberal perspectives) made me realize that Chinese political development is a highly contested area, fueling my desire to explore it further. As a young Chinese student, I often ponder how I should view China's political evolution.

**知行合一: 理论与实践相结合,讲述个人实践经历**

With the philosophy of combining knowledge with action, I applied the qualitative research methods I learned in my social science courses to conduct field research related to Chinese government governance. Since 2021, I have actively participated in hometown field surveys organized by the South China Rural Research Center at Sun Yat-Sen University. I visited local government departments and conducted semi-structured interviews on topics such as education, logistics, marriage, elderly care, and housing. I interviewed dozens of government officials and hundreds of villagers and county residents. During this time, I read 5-10 research reports daily, gaining in-depth knowledge of grassroots governance. Combining my academic knowledge with the information obtained from the fieldwork, I completed five field research reports, two of which were funded and awarded by my university. I deeply value every research opportunity, as these experiences provide first-hand data. Particularly, my conversations with government officials made me realize the critical role of political governance in people's lives and how government policies affect various aspects of the economy and everyday life. This also reinforced my understanding that implementing sound political policies requires strong governance analysis skills, which in turn demand comprehensive knowledge of Chinese politics and development.

**看课下饭: 港科大GCS以量化研究而知名,自己量化分析水平有所不足,港科大的课程设定恰好填补了自身不足**

**坦诚自己本科在定量研究方法上比较薄弱,只学过简单的回归分析和SPSS软件,这让他在研究中感到吃力。**

However, I believe my undergraduate coursework was somewhat limited, particularly in **quantitative research methods**. During my undergraduate years, I only took one course on quantitative research, which focused on basic applications of simple regression analysis and the use of SPSS software. It did not cover more advanced quantitative methods or software. As a result, when I tried to apply quantitative methods in my research, I often felt inadequate. In modern social science research, quantitative analysis methods are crucial, as they allow researchers to explore areas that qualitative methods cannot. Moreover, mastering quantitative analysis is beneficial not only for research but also for future career development, such as working in government positions. Additionally, the master's level of study offers more specialized perspectives, and to become a skilled policy researcher or government official, a deeper understanding of Chinese politics, culture, history, and humanities is indispensable.

**明确为何么选择这个学校和专业,这个专业的课程能为你自己带来何种提升**

When browsing the website of the Global China Studies (GCS) program at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), I was delighted to find many quantitative research courses, such as ***Quantitative Analysis of Social Data\*** and ***Applied Regression Analysis of Social Data\***. Through these courses, I can learn to analyze social data using various regression models, including multiple linear regression and its extensions. I will also master data management techniques, explore unconventional data types, and understand causal inference methods, all while gaining skills in **data visualization**. These quantitative research methods are precisely what I need, as they will provide me with the analytical skills essential for future research and employment, such as working in government positions.

------

**此处还提了科大社科院教授的研究方向与研究成果,表明自己对此的兴趣**

After carefully reading Professor James Lee's research on the social and geographical origins of educational elites in China since 1865, I was impressed by his expertise in quantitative research methods and historical sociology. Through reading his other works, I realized that academic research is a lifelong pursuit. Moreover, building on previous research and drawing from both Chinese and Western research methods and theories, such as social elite theory and quantitative analysis, are essential for academic research. HKUST's Division of Social Science is home to many faculty members with diverse academic backgrounds, and I believe that studying in the GCS program will not only provide me with broader research perspectives but also equip me with the skills and innovative spirit needed for both academic and professional success. More importantly, in view of my ambition to become a government official, I am excited to the opportunity to learn, contribute and grow in such a diverse, vibrant and academically challenging environment, and I feel certain that both Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and **[redacted]** will help me to realize my potential.



### 范文2

**Personal Statement**

"The physical charm lies not in the formulas, but in how it helps you understand the world." I first heard this sentence when my teacher gave a lecture in middle school. At that time, I didn't fully understand the deeper meaning behind it. Later, I gradually realized that physics is not just about solving problems, calculations, and derivations, but a way of seeing through the essence of the world. The falling of an apple, the appearance of a rainbow, the flow of electric current, the twinkling of stars... Behind these seemingly ordinary phenomena, there are strict mathematical frameworks and elegant physical laws. What truly made me fall in love with physics was not a specific knowledge point, but the experience accumulated through exploration: the perseverance in not giving up when faced with difficult problems, and the sense of sudden enlightenment when solving unknown issues.

------

我曾丝以为,通往物理学的道路是一条坦途。高中时,我全身心地投入物理学习,享受推导公式和解构物理现象的过程。每一次在黑板前与同学讨论解题思路,每一次在草稿纸上推导复杂计算,每一次在绞尽脑力后突然顿悟,都是我人生中最快乐的时刻。然而,竞赛的训练虽然磨练了我的思维,却导致我在高考中没考取理想的成绩,以至未能进入国内顶尖物理专业。面对现实,我没有放弃,而是想尽一切办法继续学习物理——到物理系旁听课程,阅读《费曼物理学讲义》,积极向教授请教,努力让自己在物理的道路上走下去。

------

It might not be physics itself, but it still gave me the opportunity to learn core courses such as **theoretical mechanics**, **electrodynamics**, and **mathematical physics methods**. When studying Maxwell's equations, I marveled at the unity of electromagnetic theory; during the derivation process of Hamiltonian mechanics, I deeply appreciated the harmonious beauty between mathematics and physics. I also tried to analyze physical problems visually through C programming and numerical simulations. This made me realize that physics can not only be used to understand the world but can also be made more practical by using computation and modeling to make abstract theories more actionable.

------

虽然它本身不是物理学,但还是给了我学习理论力学、电动力学和数学物理方法等核心课程的机会。在学习麦克斯韦方程时,我惊叹于电磁理论的统一性;在汉密尔顿力学的推导过程中,我深深体会到数学与物理的和谐之美。我还会试过通过C语言编程和数值模拟,直观地分析物理问题。这让我意识到,物理学不仅仅可以用来认识世界,还可以通过计算和建模让抽象的理论变得更加实用。

But merely understanding physics is not enough; I wanted to go further and create new ways of understanding. In my junior year, I began to truly participate in research. I teamed up with XXX. Facing this entirely new field, we were initially unfamiliar even with the key professional terms. However, we started from scratch by reviewing literature, selecting research directions, and designing calculation methods. In the first few weeks, we immersed ourselves in papers and data, trying to learn how to conduct material calculations on a supercomputing platform. Debugging parameters, writing calculation codes, and analyzing data... We successfully reproduced the results of existing studies and gradually understood the properties of two-dimensional magnetic materials in the process.

------

但仅仅理解物理是不够的,我更想进一步,创造新的理解方式。大三那年,我开始真正参与科研。面对这个全新的领域,我开始连关键的专业术语都不熟悉。但是,我们从零开始,查阅文献、选择研究方向、设计计算方法。最初几周,我们沉浸在论文和数据中,努力学习如何在超级计算平台上进行材料计算。调试参数、撰写计算代码、分析数据... 我们成功地再现了已有的研究成果,并在此过程中逐渐了解了二维磁性材料的特性。

In my graduation project, I continued to deepen this direction, with scattered modeling methods and parameter optimization. Initially, I tried to solve it independently, but after multiple adjustments, I still didn't obtain reasonable results. After discussing with a senior student, I successfully mastered the calculation method of mxsolver and completed the simulation. In the past, I was used to solving problems on my own, but now I understand that learning to ask specific questions and communicate efficiently is a crucial ability in scientific research collaboration.

------

在毕业设计中,我继续深化这一方向,我用了分散建模方法和参数优化。起初,我尝试独立求解,但经过多次调整,仍然没有得到合理的结果。在与一位学长讨论后,我成功掌握了mxsolver 的计算方法,并完成了仿真。过去,我习惯了独自解决问题,但现在我明白,学会提出具体问题并进行有效沟通是科研合作中的一项重要能力。

It is these experiences that have further confirmed that physics is the direction I want to continue studying, which is also the reason I am applying to your esteemed university. Your university's physics program is internationally leading in several fields, including **condensed matter physics**, **theoretical physics**, **optics**, and **materials science**, and boasts a high-level faculty team with close collaborations with major research institutions. I hope that during my studies at your university, I can not only solidify my theoretical foundation but also develop my independent research abilities in a more professional research environment. Moreover, Paris, as a world-class academic center, brings together many physicists and research institutions, providing rich resources for academic exchange and research collaboration. Here, I can be exposed to cutting-edge physics research, discuss problems with scholars from all over the world, and expand my horizons. In the future, I hope to become a university teacher, lead my own research team, contribute to the fields of condensed matter physics or computational physics, and promote the application of new materials in information technology and energy. But more than the research results themselves, I hope to pass on this passion for exploration and way of thinking to more students, so they too can enjoy the joy that physics brings and cultivate the next generation of physicists. Therefore, I look forward to joining my esteemed university.

正是这些经历进一步确定了物理学是我想继续学习的方向,这也是我申请贵校的原因。贵校的物理学专业在凝聚态物理、理论物理、光学和材料科学等多个领域处于国际领先地位,拥有一支高水平的师资队伍,并与主要研究机构有紧密的合作关系。我希望在贵校学习期间,不仅能夯实自己的理论基础,还能在更加专业的研究环境中培养自己的独立研究能力。此外,巴黎作为世界级的学术中心,汇聚了众多物理学家和研究机构,为学术交流和研究合作提供了丰富的资源。在这里,我可以接触到最前沿的物理研究,与来自世界各地的学者探讨问题,开拓视野。未来,我希望能成为一名大学教师,带领自己的研究团队,在凝聚态物理或计算物理领域做出贡献,推动新材料在信息技术和能源领域的应用。但比起研究成果本身,我更希望能把这种探索的热情和思维方式传递给更多的学生,让他们也能享受物理学带来的乐趣,培养下一代物理学家。因此,我期待着加入贵校这所令人尊敬的大学。

　　 榜样的力量是非常重要的，比起那些不切实际的劝告，有一个优秀的目标能够给我们非常足的动力去做事

## JK·罗琳



It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all - in which case, you fail by default.

If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.

It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.

We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all the power wee need inside ourselves already. We have the power to imagine better.

Those who choose not to empathize enable real monsters; for without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collide with it through our own apathy.

其中有三句是jk罗琳在哈佛大学演讲时的名句，我也非常喜欢这个演讲。

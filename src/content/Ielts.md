part3是学术对话

注意选项

part4是学术演讲。学术演讲要注意听懂话题，然后听到对应词的时候才能反应出来具体意思

方法： 1.背相关词汇（推荐《[王陆语料库](https://search.bilibili.com/all?from_source=webcommentline_search&keyword=王陆语料库&seid=336967470671327495)》，场景词：博主会整理文档链接） 2.精听（作为复盘），泛读为主（小站雅思等软件，听真题。)tips：错的那一句话能默写

演讲不容易定位

https://m.isixue.com/article/422064/

part1和part4一般是填空题，part2和part3一般是选择题或者匹配题,也不排除1-4都是选择题或者1-4都是填空题

part2或者part3会有地图：会有一个基础定位，根据基础定位其他，比如Main entrance、left、right这种

Part4

必须练好在有限的时间内充分审题、审题到位（原因看b站的视频讲解或以往文章），807单词的听音识别敏感度以及拼写准确性，加上听题过程从大定位到小定位锁死答案（需要利用错题练习精听与跟读，提升专注力）

**匹配题和选择题可以听关键词，但是听力的填空题和阅读的填空题一样，都需要精听，不需要听懂很多，但是要定位到，且较全面的理解。同时需要判断这里是需要副词还是名字，才好进行精听**

除以上内容之外，加大精听与跟读量。

如果水平已经很高，即能听懂大部分内容，但是准确率不理想，那重点从审题和听题定位着手[提升方法](https://zhida.zhihu.com/search?content_id=167737160&content_type=Article&match_order=1&q=提升方法&zhida_source=entity)技巧；如果在7分左右，除了以上，要补充中级段的任务

段落匹配题/段落主旨题/heading简单

雅思的分值范围决定了高分难拿，如果一篇14个题目只错4个，以为做的还不错，但是3篇错12个，也只能拿6.5

想拿到7分，三篇要错10个以内，因此这不仅意味着三篇都要看懂，且题目都找到正确答案，对于较长且生词可能比较多的文章，这确实比较难，至于7.5以上，就要对每一个可能错误的题目精雕细琢了

#### 做题顺序

整体题一般放到最后做，可以先做细节填空题，然后人名匹配。然后是选择和判断 最后headings或者contain题

#### 总结填空题

并非前后对应、需要找细节句

技巧：方法一：先用关键词定位语句，**然后找同义词**，可能在关键词前一句或者后一句

原文： From our earliest origins, man has been making use of glass, historians have discovered that a type of natural glass-obsidian-formed in places such as the mouth of a volcano as a result of the intense hert of an eruption melting sand-was first used as tips form spears.Archaeologists have even found evidence of man-made glass which dates back to 4000 BC;this took the form of glazes used for coating stone beads.It was not until 1500 BC, however, that the first hollow glass container was made by converting a sand core with a layer of molten glass.

选项：

Early humans used a material called xx to make the sharp point of their xx

4000 BC: xx made of stone were covered in a coating of man-made glassy

1. Early humans === earliest origins, 
2. sharp points === tips
3. Called、refer to、Known as，术语，找破折号的地方
4. 介词  of xxx， for xxx 是同义 yyy of xxx、yyy in xxx 、that 宾语从句同义，
5. stone beads === xxx made of stone
6. due to xxx of the raw material === because of the xxx in the 

原文：In Britain, the modem glass industry only really started to develop after the repeal of the Excise Act in 1845. Before that time, heavy taxes had been placed on the amount of glass melted in a glasshouse, and were levied continuously from 1745 to 1845. Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace at London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 marked the beginning of glass as a material used in the building industry. This revolutionary new building encouraged the use of glass in public, domestic and horticultural architecture. Glass manufacturing techniques also improved with the advancement of science and the development of better technology.

Mid-19th century: British glass production developed after changes to laws concerning xx

   The line graph demonstrates the main motivations people expressed for relocating to the countryside from the urban area of a capital city in 1900, 2000 and 2010.The year witnessed a large number of people moving away.

​    According to the graph, the major reason for relocation was the rising cost of living.In 1990, 65000 people left the city because of this, then the number peaked at 85000 in 2000, before going down a bit by 5000 in the decade between 2000 and 2010.

​    It was a different story for traffic and lifestyle: both had the same number of city leavers at 20000 at the start of the period, much lower than that of rising cost of living.Subsequently,both categories saw increases, with traffic first going up by a large number to 35000 by the year 2000, and then even more steeply to 60000 by 2010; lifestyle leavers rose consistently oevr the whole period, go eventually up to 40000.

​     The bar chart demonstrates the coffee-and-tea buying and drinking preferences of residents in five Australia cities.It show the proportion of residents who bought fresh or instant coffee, and those that went to a cafe for coffee or tea in the last four weeks.

​	 According to the chart, most residents in the cities went out for coffee or tea-over 60% in Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart, and around 55% in Brisbane: these numbers are generally much higher than those of buying fresh or instant coffee.Adelaide is an exception with slightly less than half of its people going out, also one or two percent lower than buying instant coffee.

​	 Among those who bought coffee, around half(45-55%) of the people in the cities bought iinstant coffee; on the other hand, fewer people bought fresh coffee though the difference varied: from a few percent in Sydney and Melbourne to about half the number of those who bought instant coffee in Brisbane, Adelaide, and Hobart.

​	  In conclusion, most residents in the five Australian cities drink coffee or tea, and they seem to prefer convenient ways of drinking(coffee or tea from a shop or instant coffee) to making their own drink.

**The table and charts below give information on the police budget for 2017 and 2018 in one area of Britain. The table shows where the money came from and the charts show how it was distributed.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

The table and pie charts provide information about the 2017-18 police budget of one area of Britain. The table displays the sources of the budget's funds while the charts show where the funds went.

In 2017, the police had a total budget of £304.7 million, which rose significantly to £318.6 million in 2018. The majority of this money was sourced from the national government, with an increase from £175.5 million to £177.8 million. Of all sources of funding, local taxes saw the largest growth from £91.2 million to £102.3 million, whilst other sources accounted for £38.5 million of the total budget in 2018, £0.5 million more than the previous year.

Expenditure primarily consisted of officer and staff salaries, although the proportion decreased from 75% of the total to 69%. However, spending on technology almost doubled from 8% to 14%, whereas expenditure on buildings and transport remained unchanged at 17%.

Overall, the total police budget increased with the national government being the biggest funder in both years. In terms of expenditure, salaries remained the primary form of expenditure.

**The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

The line graph shows global water consumption in three different sectors between 1900 and 2000, while the table compares water use in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2000.

Agriculture remained the most water-consuming industry. It used about 500 km3 of water in 1900 and this number increased dramatically to around 3,000 km3 in 2000. Less than 100 km3 of water was used for either industrial or residential purposes in 1900. Not until around 1950 did water consumption rise significantly, eventually reaching by 2000 roughly 1000 km3 for the former and 500 km3 for the latter.

Brazil had a population of 176 million, an irrigated land area of 26,500 km2, and a per capita water consumption of 359 m3. **In comparison**, the corresponding figures for Congo were only 5.2 million, 100 km2, and 8 m3. This made Brazil a much larger water user than Congo.

Overall, water consumption increased in all three sectors but agriculture consumed far more water than the other two. Brazil was a much bigger water consumer than Congo.

**The most important aim of science should be to improve people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?**

While enhancing human well-being through science is important, I believe that by no means should it be solely the primary goal of science. Equally important are safeguarding the environment and respecting animal rights.

In the practice of science, the improvement of human lives should never come at the cost of the environment. As the world’s population increases, creating better ways to produce food, such as more effective pesticides, becomes vital. Yet, if the focus remains solely on boosting crop yields, the pesticides developed may not only affect pests but also make the land infertile, worsening the preexisting issue of food scarcity. This highlights the importance of taking a balanced approach to scientific advancement that focuses on caring for both human lives and the health of the environment that they depend on.

Furthermore, testing drugs on animals raises serious ethical concerns. Ensuring the safety of novel medicines for human use is critical, but prioritizing human health over animal rights is morally unacceptable. Animals, much like humans, experience emotions and share the right to live freely and without unnecessary suffering. Subjecting them to prolonged captivity solely for testing can result in both physical and psychological suffering. As moral beings, we have a responsibility to treat animals compassionately and avoid such acts of brutality in the name of human betterment.

In conclusion, although improving people’s lives is an important aim of science, I believe that it should never overshadow other vital objectives within the field. We must also give equal priority to environmental preservation and animal welfare, striking a balance between scientific progress and ethics for a better world.

***Some people think that wild animals should not be kept in zoos. Others believe that there are good reasons for having zoos.***

*Wild animals are kept in zoos all over world. At present, zoos are a tourist attraction in many countries and need wild animals to attract vistors. I heire that wild creatures should not be kept in zoos and there should be alternative ways to see them.* 

*There are many good reasons for having zoos in our cities. Most importantly, they attract tourists and make money for city. Visitors get chance to see wild animals that they would not see unless they travelled far away. Rare species, like Chinese panda, or Indian tiger, or African rhino for example, are endangered and if we had no zoos they would die. Zoos care for these aminals and give us chance to see them. Therefore, we cannot underestimate he educational importance of zoos.* 

*However, many people feel that wild animals should be free. They should not be kept in cages and small areas in zoo. This is cruel for animal and they often die because they is not in natural habitat. We frequently see news story about rare animals dying in zoos or getting sick because area is not big enough or suitable for wild animals like lions or polar bears. Also, these animals are unhappy and sometimes attack humans. Caging wild animals is unhealthy for the animals and is cruel.* 

*Both views put forward valid points, however, I strongly believe that zoos are no place for wild animals. If animals need to be cared for, they should be looked after in heir natural habitat in game parks or wildlife reserves. Goverments should look after the precious wild animals at their country and should close down zoos that profit from them.* 

*In conclusion, although people believe that zoos are good places to keep wild animals because they can earn money and educate people, I feel that we do not need zoos anymore. We can look at wild animals on the internet and we can feel happy knowing that they are free.*

Some people think that most crimes are the result of circumstances like povety and other social problems, others believe that they are caused by people who are bad by nature.Disscuss both views and give your own opinion.

Many criminals continue to commit crimes even after being punished.What do you think are the causes?How can we solve this problem

Some people think that all lawbreakers should be sent to prison, while others think that there are better alternatives for those whose crimes are minor, such as making them do work for the local community.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

Today, there is a heated debate on the root cause of crimes: some claims crimes as the resultss of external factor such as povety while others think that crimes are caused by people bad by nature.In my opinion, most crimes are the result of external social factors, while crimes due to "bad nature" are also the result of external circumstances,namely social negligence.

First, social and ecnonmic conditions are key social factor in determining people's values and behavioral tendencies, also the most important external variables on crimes.**To be more specific**, a lack in financial resources could prevent one's access to education, and then further limits his or her access to decent jobs, driving him or her toward crime as the only means of sucvival and forming a vicious cycle in the family and nerghborhood;in addition, those who grow up in a family without proper guidance or a neighborhood prevalent with crimes could lack appropiate moral values and even treat crimes as a norm.As a result, a systematic campaign against povety and social injustice would be the solution to such crimes.

Still, we cannot deny the fact that certain individuals are born with personality disorders, such as a genetic irritability, lack of empathy and sympathy, result in a 'bad nature' and their criminal behaviors later in life.However, such crimes are exactly the result of a negligence from the society, which eventually get them lost on their path and succumb to the desire of crime.In other words, external social elements  such as guidance from family, supportive systems including bug not limited to specail education and proper medical treatment, and a tolerant social atmosphere can together form a synergy and work towad an effective crime prevention, and even turn these individuals who a bad by nature into productive and valuabel components of the society.

In conclusion, crime is a complex issue, and it is the construction of a healthy and supportive social enviorment that can best prevent crimes.With appropriate external intervention, even those with inherent mental or phycological issues could grow to be talents, staying away form crime. 

**Some people think that environmental problems are too big for individuals to solve. Others, however, believe that these problems cannot be solved if individuals do not take actions. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.**

Whether individuals are the primary force in containing environmental problems has long been debated. In my opinion, individuals are essential in the solving of certain issues, while they play a minor or even non-existence role in others.

First, for environmental problems that are closely related to individual’s actions in life, such as air pollution caused by traffic and garbage classification, it is natural that individual’s actions matter greatly in solving them. For example, if each citizen drives less and take public transportation more frequently, there would be much fewer smog days in the city; if each person actively and appropriately classifies their trash, more would be recycled while less landfill and raw materials used.

Second, the solving of macro environmental problems that are caused on an industrial scale usually have little to do with individual’s action but closely related to governmental regulation. For example, the emission of pollutants into water is usually caused by manufacturing, and only state authorities are able to regulate such pollution through incentives such as penalties for heavy polluters and subsidies for new clean technology.

Last but not the least, the control on certain problems requires actions from both individuals and businesses. For example, air pollution is not only caused by traffic but emission from factories and even the farming of cattles, and it is through the synergy among all these involved parties that an effective measure can be taken.

**Some people think watching TV is bad for children in every way. Others think it is good for developing children as they grow up. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**

There is much debate regarding the effects of TV viewing on children. In my opinion, when watched in moderation, educational TV shows can be beneficial for children because they help them develop positive values as they grow up.

On the one hand, those who believe that TV viewing harms children in every way may argue that it is a passive activity that encourages sedentary behavior and limits meaningful play. This can lead to a range of problems, such as poor health and cognitive development. However, I believe that this argument is only valid if children spend too much time in front of the screen. Parents can protect their children from the potential dangers of TV viewing by setting reasonable time limits and providing adequate supervision.

On the other hand, there are people who argue that many TV programs are educational and can instill good values in children. For example, Disney movies often portray characters with admirable traits, such as courage, kindness, and perseverance, which can inspire children to emulate these values and become better individuals. This has led me to believe that educational television programs can be excellent tools for teaching children moral lessons as they grow and develop. Many children find traditional forms of education boring or difficult, but the visual and interactive nature of TV can make learning more engaging and enjoyable.

In conclusion, although prolonged passive television viewing can be detrimental, watching educational TV shows in moderation can have a positive impact on children’s development. Such shows can effectively impart valuable lessons and teach positive values in an engaging and entertaining manner. 

##### Two parts

**Many museums and historical sites are mainly visited by tourists rather than local people. Why is this? What can be done to encourage local people to visit? **

It is a common phenomenon today that many museums and historical sites worldwide are packed by tourists rather than local people. In my opinion, as far as national culture is concerned, we ought to take measures to encourage the local to visit these sites.

First of all, people are driven by an intrinsic curiosity to explore what they are not familiar with, and many deem what are demonstrated in museums and historical sites “boring” as they might have seen them on TV or heard about them in their daily life; furthermore, the rapid progress of economic and technological development in recent decades have also promoted the flow of people worldwide. As a result, people around the globe are no longer satisfied with what they can see in the locality but would like to visit exotic foreign cultures, which are usually well-represented by museums and historical sites.

Such phenomenon is a dire issue that needs to be addressed as an understanding of national culture is the very base of national unity. Citizens ought to have a good understanding of who they are and where they belong before they can be united to work efficiently and create progress for the society. Museums and historical sites are the carriers of national culture, and we ought to take measures to encourage local people to visit them.

Technological and financial measures can be used to promote locals to visit museums and historical sites. To be more specific, tools such as multimedia tours with music and videos could be applied to a museum together with the exhibits, attracting visitors both young and old; in addition, subsidies could be issued to locals, especially young children and students, as they are in the stage of forming a cultural understanding and are the future of our nation

**Health experts claim that walking is the best exercise. However, people are walking less on a daily basis. What has made it happen and how to deal with this?**

It is a common phenomenon today that people are walking less in daily life. From my perspective, we ought to take measures to encourage people to participate in exercise such as walking for health reasons. 

First of all, the transportation nowadays has been well developed during the process of modernization and is very convenient for people to go anywhere. Whether it is long-distance or short-distance travel, people have a variety of choices, such as buses, subway, cars and so on. They have fewer opportunities to walk on a daily basis. In addition, with the rapid development of technology and economy, people in modern society live a fast-paced life that they prefer to rest at home at spare time or often sit still in front of electronic products.

Such phenomenon is a dire issue that needs to be addressed as it is an unhealthy lifestyle which causes health problems like obesity, even heart disease. On the contrary, taking exercise is not only beneficial to physical health, but also can promote mental health. It is a well-known theory that when people feel down, they can do some exercise and then they will release the pressure.

Technological and political measures can be used to encourage people to take exercise more. To be more specific, the combination of fitness equipment and electronic products can be used to make people interested in walking and other sports through games. In addition, the government as well as the media should collaborate together to make widespread coverage of the benefits of taking exercise and advocate people to choose green manners to go outside.

## 题型构成

### 口语：三个部分 

强推：**Shelly猫咪英语星球**

口语最重要的是回答问题，所以先组织，然后用英语表达，而不是用英语完美回答.不要背了单词和高级表达，一直在扣发音，结果到考场一紧张啥表达都忘了，而且没话说，练的发音p用没有，还是得积累素材，丰富自己的回答

（part1 4分半-5分钟，简单的个人信息，考察基本对话能力，⭐️关注口语题库，全部过一遍） 

（part2 一个大问题，下面四个小问题，1min准备时间，回答2min左右的话题，考察独立组织长段语言能力） （part3 深入提问。考官针对考生第二部分回答内容，深问，即兴考察。） 

考察重点：发音(有没有口音)、词汇、语法、流畅度

tips：重在口语，沟通感，交流感，而不是背句子。加入插入语basically等，多讲自己的例子像when I was in high school balabala…

尽量不要用相同的方式回答问题

**身份确认**

what's your name/where are you from/do you work or study/Do you travel outside/What would you do if you had an opportunity?/Have you ever learnt about stars and outer space

建议：I live in x/I work as a Y at xxx /i study at Z

不建议：i am already a worker

举例: I'm currently majoring in computer science. I am actually gonna be a fresh graduate this year, and i 've already secured a job working as a software engineer at a tech startup.

 I work. I've been working as a front-end engineer at an internet company for five years now.

**What is your job**

I'm a front-end engineer. My job involves designing and developing the user interface of websites and web applications. I use various programming languages and tools to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. It's quite different from what I studied in university, actually.

**Introduce your hometown**

Sure. My hometown is in Lvliang, Shanxi Province.Lvliang is a beautiful city with a long history. It's located in the west of Shanxi Province and is known for its rich cultural heritage. There are many ancient temples and traditional architecture that reflect the wisdom of our ancestors. The natural scenery is also stunning. We have some mountains which offer great views and are perfect for hiking. The air is fresh and the environment is quite peaceful. It's a place where you can really relax and enjoy the simple life

**it's not a big city. It's more like a collection of small towns and rural areas. The population is not very large, and the pace of life is quite slow.**

**Lüliang is a place with a lot of mountains. The landscape is really beautiful, but the mountains also make transportation a bit difficult. There are not many highways or railways, so traveling can take a long time. Because of this, the area is not as developed as some other places in China. The economy is a bit poor, and there aren't many big industries or factories. Most people live in small towns or villages and rely on agriculture.**

**What did you study in university**

I studied mechanical engineering in university. It was a very different field from what I'm doing now. Mechanical engineering focuses more on the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems, while my current job is all about coding and user experience on the web. But I'm glad I was able to make the transition and find a career that I enjoy.

**为什么选择这个专业**

To be honest, i wasn't entirely sure at first,but after taking a psychology elective, i realized i'm passinate about understanding human behavior.Plus, mental health careers have growing demand in the market.

**日常做什么**/最喜欢工作的那一部分

Definitely the brainstorming sessions!When our team has lightbulb moments and solves a tricky problem together, it's incredibly rewarding.

**规划**

Absolutely! I plan to pursue master's degree in AI abroad.It'll open up more career advancement opportunities, though my ultimate goal is to have entrepreneurial aspirations-maybe start my own tech company

**家乡变化**

Definitely!My hometown has undergone significant transformations -we have got new shopping malls and bike lanes.However, i miss the old-school tea houses that used to be everywhere

**居住城市/住所（Accommodation）/社区**

Where do you live

 I live in Suzhou, a city known for its beautiful gardens and rich cultural history. It's located in Jiangsu Province, in the eastern part of China.

How long have you lived there

I've been living in Suzhou for about 10 years now. I moved here for my university education and decided to stay because of the city's charm and the opportunities it offers.

Do you like living in suzhou?

Yes, I really enjoy living in Suzhou. It's a blend of traditional culture and modern development. The city is clean, safe, and has a good quality of life. Plus, it's close to Shanghai, which is convenient for travel and business.

What do you like most in Suzhou?

What I like most about Suzhou is its serene environment and the beautiful classical gardens. They provide a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. Additionally, the local cuisine is fantastic, offering a variety of flavors that are unique to the region.

Is any thing you don't like in Suzhou

Like any city, Suzhou has its challenges. One of the things I find a bit challenging is the traffic during peak hours. However, the city is continuously improving its public transportation system, which is helping to alleviate this issue.

What are some popular tourist attractions in Suzhou

Suzhou is famous for its classical gardens, such as the Humble Administrator's Garden and the Lingering Garden, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Additionally, the city has beautiful canals and historic districts like Pingjiang Road, which offer a glimpse into the city's rich history.

I live in a compact one-bedroom flat in a mid-rise apartment complex on the outskirts of the city.It's not luxurious, but it has basic amenities like a gym and 24-hour security

I have been here for 3 years straight and grown quite attached to it.The best part is the rooftop garden where i grow herbs.Sure, the elevator breaks sometimes, but overall i can't complain!

My dream home would have an open-play layout and a spacious balcony with a view of the mountains. Ideally, it'd be within walking distance of a part and include eco-friendly features like solar panels

Absolutely!It has a tight-knit community vibe-nerghbors organize weekend markets.Plus, family friendly amenities like playgrounds and libraries make it ideal for kids.

We have got a bustling commercial street packed with cafes, and a 24/7 convenience store right downstairs.And what's amazing is, we have plenty of green spaces around!There are three parks within walking distance



I usually eat bread and drink milk for breakfast. Sometimes I have an egg too. Bread is easy to eat, and milk is good for my health. An egg gives me more energy.

性格

I used to be very introverted and quiet as a child.But as time passed, i think i tried very hard to fit in with others and i think my personality change because of it.

周末干啥

Do you think it is important to make the most of your weekend

I think it is important to make the most of the weekend. It’s a great time to relax and recharge after a busy week. I usually spend some time with my family or friends, or do something I enjoy like watching Bilibili, a platform like YouTube, and reading or going for a walk. It helps me feel refreshed and ready for the next week

Do you prefer to spend time alone or with others on weekends

I actually enjoy both spending time alone and with others on weekends. When I’m alone, I can focus on my hobbies like reading or doing some creative writing. It’s a good time for me to relax and recharge. But I also love spending time with friends or family. We might go out for a meal, watch a movie together, or just chat. It’s nice to catch up and share experiences. So, I think a mix of both is perfect for me.

Do you think older people who wear T- shirts are fashionable

I think it really depends on the person and how they wear it. If an older person wears a T-shirt that suits them and they look confident in it, then I’d say they are definitely fashionable. Fashion is about feeling good in what you wear and expressing yourself, not just about following trends. So, if a T-shirt makes an older person feel comfortable and stylish, then it’s a fashionable choice.

Do you think T shirt with pictures is better?

I think T-shirts with pictures can be really interesting and stylish. They’re a great way to express your personality and show off your interests. For example, if you’re a fan of a particular movie or band, wearing a T-shirt with their logo or a related picture can be a fun conversation starter. It adds a unique touch to your outfit and makes it more eye-catching. However, I also like simple T-shirts without pictures, especially for everyday wear. It really depends on the occasion and what you feel comfortable in. Overall, I think both types of T-shirts have their own charm.

What kinds of music do you like to listen to

 I don’t really listen to music -I suppose if I listen to any kind it would be pop music, but! only listen to that when it’s on. I’m not really interested in music very much

Do you like changes?Why?

I think i like changes. I wanna try new things if i have the chance.

问题：

Describe a character from a story/film/TV programme. You should say: who this character is when you first saw/read about him/her what kind of person this character is

The character I’d like to talk about is Optimus Prime from the Transformers series. He is the leader of the Autobots, a group of heroic robots who can transform into various vehicles and machines. I first encountered him when I was quite young, probably around the early 2000s. It was during the revival of the Transformers franchise with the new animated series and the first live-action movie directed by Michael Bay. I remember being fascinated by the concept of robots transforming into cars and trucks, and Optimus Prime stood out as the most iconic character.

Optimus Prime is a truly remarkable character. He is incredibly brave and selfless. Throughout the series, he is always willing to put himself in danger to protect others, especially the humans he considers his friends. He is also very wise and strategic. He often comes up with clever plans to outsmart the Decepticons, who are the evil faction in the Transformers universe. His leadership is inspiring, and he is always there to guide and support his fellow Autobots.

One of the things I really admire about Optimus Prime is his strong sense of justice. He believes in doing what is right, no matter how difficult the situation. He is also very compassionate. He cares deeply about the lives of others and is always looking for peaceful solutions before resorting to battle. Despite being a powerful robot, he has a gentle side and a strong moral compass.

In addition, Optimus Prime is very loyal. He is fiercely loyal to his friends and his mission. He never gives up, no matter how tough the fight gets. His perseverance and dedication are truly admirable. He is a role model for many people, showing that true strength comes not just from physical power, but also from inner strength and integrity.

Overall, Optimus Prime is a character who embodies many positive qualities. He is brave, wise, compassionate, and loyal. He is a hero who always stands up for what is right and protects those who cannot protect themselves. I think he is a great example of what it means to be a true leader and a true hero. Even as I’ve grown older, I still find his character inspiring and timeless.

**Describe a person you met at a party who you enjoyed talking with You should say:   What party it was  What party it was  How you met this person What you talked about  And explain why you enjoyed talking with him or her**

Okay, I’d like to talk about a person I met at a party who I really enjoyed talking with.

It was a birthday party of one of my close friends. It was a big gathering held at a local restaurant, with lots of people from different social circles. The atmosphere was lively and cheerful, with music playing and everyone chatting animatedly.

I met this person, let’s call her Mary, when I was standing near the buffet table. She was also getting some food, and we struck up a conversation about the delicious dishes. It turned out that we both had a shared interest in cooking, which was a great starting point for our chat. We talked about our favorite recipes, cooking techniques, and even some cooking shows we enjoyed watching. She was really knowledgeable and had some great tips to share.

We also talked about our hobbies and daily lives. Mary mentioned that she loved traveling and had recently been to a few interesting places. She shared some of her travel experiences, like the beautiful landscapes she had seen and the local cultures she had encountered. I found her stories fascinating and couldn’t help but ask lots of questions. She was very open and engaging, and her enthusiasm was contagious.

I enjoyed talking with Mary because she was so easy to talk to and had a positive attitude. She was genuinely interested in what I had to say and made me feel comfortable. Our conversation flowed naturally, and the time just flew by. It was refreshing to meet someone with similar interests and who could share such interesting experiences. I left the party feeling really happy about that conversation and hoping that I would see her again sometime.

One person who really stands out to me is my older cousin, Jack.I met him when i was at my young bug we have only really started connecting more over the past few years.Jack is one of those people

He's always reading something—whether it's history, philosophy, politics, or even obscure books that nobody else really knows about. He's the kind of person who's always looking for new ideas, and that's made him incredibly knowledgeable.

Jack is definitely someone with strong opinions. When he believes in something, he doesn't hold back. One time, we were talking about a popular movie that everyone seemed to love, I've already forgotten the name of the movie but while everyone else was praising it, Jack was the only one who pointed out every little flaw

how the plot didn't make sense, how the characters were underdeveloped, and how it was all just style over substance. He didn't just say he didn't like it—he backed it up with specific examples. His ability to critically break things down always keeps things interesting, even if it's a bit intimidating at times.

He's one of those people that everyone turns to when they need advice, and for good reason. Whether it's personal decisions or big life choices, Jack always has a perspective that challenges your way of thinking. I've often asked him for advice, especially when I'm stuck in a tricky situation.

One time, I was considering whether to change my major in college, and his advice was really eye-opening. He didn't just tell me what to do; he made me think through my own values and what I wanted to achieve. It was a bit of a wake-up call, and it completely shifted how I viewed the situation.

**Describe a person you know who has chosen a career in the medical field (e.g. a doctor, a nurse)**

Describe a person who contributes to the society

Describe an old person you know who has had an interesting life

Describe an interesting neighbor

I have this really interesting neighbor, Mr. Zhang, who is a retired traditional Chinese doctor. He's an older guy, probably in his 70s, but he's super active and always hanging around the neighborhood.We live in the same apartment building, so I first got to know him just by seeing him around. He's been practicing traditional Chinese medicine for decades, but now that he's retired, he spends his time just chatting with other elderly folks in the area.He's not the typical doctor you'd picture with a stethoscope around his neck. Instead, he's always carrying a small bag of herbs, and whenever someone needs a bit of advice on how to deal with a cough or a bad back, he's the first person they turn to.Even though he's retired, he's still really respected in the neighborhood for his knowledge of traditional medicine. You can find him sitting outside the local tea shop, drinking his herbal tea, and giving advice to anyone who walks by.

Mr. Zhang chose to become a doctor because he grew up in a family that deeply valued traditional Chinese medicine. His grandfather was also a practitioner, so it kind of runs in the family.He told me once that he was fascinated by the idea of healing people in a natural way, without relying on pills or modern surgery. That's why he pursued his career in acupuncture and herbal medicine. In a way, I think he found it not just as a job, but as his life's calling.Even though he's not working anymore, I still feel like he contributes to society. He's the kind of person who doesn't just sit at home all day; he's still very active in the community. He shares his knowledge with younger generations, offering tips about health and wellness, and even teaches people how to recognize common herbs that grow in the wild.

As for how I feel about him—well, he's honestly one of the most interesting people I've met. He has so many stories to tell about his life and work. He once told me how he treated a famous celebrity (though he's too modest to say who) or how he helped a local farmer recover from a bad accident using acupuncture.

What's even more fascinating is that he never brags about it. Instead, he just sits down with a cup of tea and shares his experiences as if they're no big deal. To me, he represents a generation that worked hard, stayed humble, and lived with purpose. I really admire him for that.

Ms. Zhang cares about the environment a lot. Well sometimes when he is taking his morning walk, he would carry a small bag and pick up litters around the neighborhood. I mean that's not something big, but I think it is something that really shows his care for the environment.

Oh right, another thing he does is grow herbs in his garden, he grows them naturally, without any pesticides or chemicals. I remember the first time he gave me a bunch of fresh mint and told me, how much better the herbs are for our health when grown that way, and how nature should be treated gently, just like our own bodies.So I guess Ms. Zhang is just someone who has a lot of love for people and nature, that he is willing to do good things for the world.

##### 政府城市类

Describe a countryside that you have been to 

I'd like to talk about a peaceful countryside village I visited called Moganshan, which is about two hours from Shanghai. It's a beautiful, quiet getaway surrounded by bamboo forests and rolling hills. I went there last year when I needed a break from city life, and it turned out to be the perfect place to relax.The village itself is small and charming, with traditional white-walled houses and little family-run guesthouses. Unlike Shanghai, where everything is fast-paced and noisy, Moganshan is completely different, it's so peaceful that you can actually hear the sound of birds and rustling bamboo leaves.

Also whenever I need some peace and quiet, I love going for early morning hikes there. The air is fresh and cool, and the view from the top of the hills is just breathtaking. It's the kind of place where you can completely clear your mind, no traffic, no crowds, just nature.What makes this place special is that it has a really rich history, it used to be a retreat for foreign missionaries and wealthy Chinese families over a hundred years ago. Some of the old stone villas are still standing, giving the village a unique, timeless feel.

So overall, Moganshan is both a beautiful countryside escape and my go-to quiet place whenever I need to recharge. I'd love to visit again and maybe even stay for a few weeks just to enjoy the slow, peaceful lifestyle.

##### 经历类

Let me tell you about the day I bought a Huawei MatePad. I was so fed up with using just my phone for online classes. It was a real struggle, so I decided I needed a tablet. Since I was on a tight budget, I didn't plan on spending a fortune. It was a total spur-of-the-moment decision.When I walked into the Huawei Store, a super friendly salesperson greeted me. She took her time, patiently comparing three different models for me. She even handed me a stylus so I could test how well it worked for note-taking.In the end, with a sweet student discount, I walked out with a mid-range MatePad and, to my delight, a pair of free earbuds. I was over the moon, feeling like I'd scored a major bargain.

After getting my MatePad, I couldn't wait to show it off to my friend who has an iPad. That's when I really noticed how far Chinese tech has come. The multi-screen feature on my MatePad worked way more smoothly than on my friend's iPad.When the saleslady told me it ran on their self-developed HarmonyOS, I felt a sense of pride. It's crazy to think that just ten years ago, Chinese tech was often considered copycat. Now, it's setting trends!

However, I have to be honest and mention a drawback. After using the tablet for a while, I discovered that it gets really laggy when I try to run multiple apps at the same time. I was so excited about the purchase that I completely forgot to check online reviews beforehand.Big mistake! This experience has definitely taught me a lesson. Next time I'm in the market for tech, I'll test it much more thoroughly. I might even film any potential issues right in the store so I have clear evidence to show customer service if I need to.

##### 教育文化类

Describe a historical period that you are interested in. You should say:

what the historical period is

how you know about this historical period 

what happened during this historical period and explain why you are interested in this historical period.

答案：

**The historical period I'm interested in is the Qin Dynasty.** It was the first imperial dynasty of China, lasting from 221 BC to 206 BC. I learned about it through history books and documentaries.

**During this period, several important things happened.** The most significant was the unification of China under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. He standardized the writing system, measurements, and currency, which helped unify the country. The Great Wall was also built to defend against northern invasions. Additionally, the Terracotta Army was created to guard his tomb.

**I'm interested in the Qin Dynasty because it marked the beginning of imperial China.** Despite its short duration, it had a profound impact on Chinese history through its reforms and centralization. It's fascinating to see how a relatively short-lived dynasty could have such a lasting influence.

What are the differences between acting in a theatre and in a film

Theatre acting and film acting are quite different. In theatre, actors need to be more expressive and exaggerated because they’re performing in front of a live audience who are far away. They also get to perform the same play multiple times, which allows them to keep refining their roles. On the other hand, film acting is more subtle. The camera can capture tiny details, so actors need to convey emotions through small gestures and expressions. Also, film scenes are often shot out of order, so actors have to keep track of their characters’ storylines across different takes. Overall, theatre is more about live interaction and repetition, while film is about capturing the perfect moments on camera

On what occasions would people be willing to get to know new people

People are usually more willing to get to know new people at social events like parties or gatherings. These occasions provide a relaxed atmosphere where people feel more open to meeting others. Also, in settings like clubs or interest groups, people share common hobbies or goals, which makes it easier to start conversations and form connections. Additionally, at work-related events or conferences, people are often there to network and expand their professional circle, so they are more proactive in meeting new people

How do people start a conversation

People usually start a conversation by finding common ground or using polite small talk. For example, they might comment on the event they're at, like the food or the atmosphere. Or they could ask about the other person's interests or background. In more formal settings, people might introduce themselves and mention their job or role. The key is to be friendly, show genuine interest, and ask open-ended questions to keep the conversation flowing.

Do you think people are familiar with their neighbors these days?

I would say these days not a lot of people woule be familiar with their neighbors.I feel like a lot of people are more the type of people to keep to themselves than to actually be nice and go out of their way to introduce themselves. to their neighbors.

I feel like in today's society many people are moy wary of strangers, even if it's their neighbors.people arn't willing to like going out of their way to being nice to someone or get to know someone, since there is like a lot of crime and violence and stories about people gettting hurt from either neighbors or something like that.

Definitely say in the countryside, it's a little bit more different.Like thinking about people who live in a farm and who tend to be further away, since they are so isolated, they want human interaction.They want to get to know people and in that way they can help each other whenever something happens.

Do young people like to go to parks?

Absolutely, many young people dig parks.They are like a nice break from our everyday stuff, a good place to step out, relax and spent time.You will see young folks jogging, prinicking, playing sports or simply hanging out with friends and family in the open air

What do old peole like to do in parks?

You know, older folks tend to really like the calm atomsphere of parks.You will often spot them taking slow walks, reading  or just sitting on benches, enjoying the green surrounding.Parks are like a peaceful the retreat for them, a place to think, chat with friends or enjoy the beauty of nature

how can people protect the environment ?

Eg：

It is widely acknowledged that people can protect environment by  doing some small things.First and foremost, people should follow some rules, which means we should reduce waste, reuse waste and recycle waste.For example, people can sort garbage and follow the garbage sorting policy, so that garbage can be recycled.On the top of that, travelling smart is a powerful way to preserve the environment.I mean people can choose public tranportation, walking to riding bicycle to commute instead of taking private cars.These are main ways that i think of.

What can schools do to develop students' awareness of volunteering?

I guess school can take a lot of actions to raise students' voluntary awareness. One possible way is that schools can hold lectures and invite teachers to impart the value and imipact of volunteer work, for instance, students might gain essensial life skills real-world experience and boost thier competitor edge on college applications.They can be motivated if they understand huge advantages of volunteering.

Another practical way i can think of is that schools can show their appreciation of student volunteers efforts by giving them extra credit, or provide positive feedback and recognize efforts of volunteers.You know, students tend to do more if the get these chances.

On top of that, schools can lead students by examples.The power of role model is infinite. I mean teenagers always imitate the actions of senior schoolmates, so if the school invite volunteers to share experience with other students, i guess more students will inspire to do the same

Generally speaking, these ways i just mentioned can be considered.

三个part

Hi,everybody. My name is XXX. I am a student in XXX. My hobbies are XXX and XXX. I like XXX. I am good at XXX,XXX. I hope that I can make friends with my classmates.



## 口语

**口语的流利度大于一切，不能犹豫和纠结，语法在口语中不计分，重要是决定要说的话**

**结尾一定要降调**

**重要的是要有一种  《不管我知不知道 我都要读出来》 这种感觉，就能流利**

**单词要读准**

**RA和RS,切忌贪多，这是第一准则，RA就10个单词，RS就后半句**

**流利度最重要，不能停，速度不要太快，发音要清晰**

**前半句说太快后半句来不及反应，结尾一定要降调！！！！降调！！！！**

### RA(75)

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Jv4y1j7Le?spm_id_from=333.788.videopod.sections&vd_source=e898668a475e6de0272851f4a5fc6328

**一句话不能停**

read aloud

默读或者练习

**一句话模式，选择大于八个单词的一句话，重点不要卡壳(专挑生词少的，虚词少的，实词多的，实词开始实词结束)，10个词左右，不要太长！！！！！！不要以虚词为结尾！！！！！！！单复数要读清楚！！！！！！！！**

**吸气，张嘴，吐词清晰，坐直**

尽量避免选择辅音密集，特别是以s、d、t、k等辅音结尾的句子

**难词可以用跳过，不要读不清！！！。飞凡：你都没读那么多单词了，不差这一个！！！最差替换，反正不要强读 尽量选第一句或者第二句**

保持流利度和自然停顿，正常语速就好

分清楚实词和虚词 **实词**包括名词、动词、形容词、数词、量词、代词六类 虚词是介词、冠词、连词

简单的篇幅全读，介词和连词轻读，比如that, at 

重要的是发音清楚和连贯

节奏、语调、语气(连读)

星际pte 同步跟读训练

意群划分：介词前停顿

辅音开头，元音结尾是最好

元音开头，连读 spin around =>  spina round

俩辅音连接，失爆， pbkgtd //. Roots systems // adapt to // introduced briefly

单词读音

as a/ is an

and community => an community

 Roots systems. 平音 复试

肚子一直吸紧，气沉丹田，声音匀速、音量一致

弱读方式

to: 不读tu 读te。 talk to me/ go to work/ go to school/ have to go/ want to see/ give it to me

of: 不读aouv, 读ef  kind of. sort of. plenty of. of all. of the

can: 不读 kan 读ken 

and 不读and。读end(元音弱毒)

节奏训练

弱弱强 be a man/on the top/in the house/for the job

强弱强 old and fat/plan of study/sleep at night

强弱弱 Come with me/good for you/think of it/share with us/far from them

强弱弱强 Most of your time /parts of the world /more than a decade/ work as a doctor

弱强弱强 From one to three/ A glass of milk

弱弱强强 It is really nice/for a few days/can be very hard/if the new technology

### RS(80)

**多音节词要说慢一点，发音要准确，发音要准确，发音要准确，重要的事情说三遍**

比如students strangely statistics

**像听wfd的感觉，反正要流利清晰地读出来听到的词，可以少，但是不要读错、乱读、卡顿，难句的话实词一般会重读，好听些，简单句就前半句或者后半句，重要的是快速组织！！**

**等进度条开始一点再读！！！！不要着急！！！先理清思路！！读完不要咳嗽清嗓，读前可以**

重复句子

流利度很重要，不要卡壳，内容大于1/2

评分规则：内容只占3分，发音5分，流利度5分

而内容中，只要有50%的内容，就会有2分，因此**完全不必纠结内容**，相反，如果一边思考一边说，犹豫影响到发音和流利度，则得不偿失

**4-5个词，建议直接记前半句/后半句就好，听不懂过的词直接跳过**

**不要贪不要贪不要贪。重要的事情说三遍**

**最后三个**

**碎片化听力**

则可以采取以下策略：

若句子很难，没怎么听到，则用听到的2-3个单词+重复一遍

若句子简单，则可以用50%的内容(句子的前一半或者后一半)+重复一遍，

重复一遍对于最终结果可以提升4-5分

如果大部分能听到50%的内容并流利复述，则大概率可以上60+

语法和内容的补充，辨音

which is very important

短语词多。直接拿短语



### DI(describe image, 15)

很重视流利度，不要管逻辑，说25秒()左右，进度条2/3，无情的套模版机器

描述图片，模版 

评分标准：

内容5分，图表的关键信息、图表元素之间的关系 发展趋势

发音5分，流利度5分：有正确的发音和语调、语速不要过快或者过慢

首尾很重要！！！！不在乎内容

Nowadays, many headlines hit the newspaper on the topic of （题干主题词）. This issue has sparked a huge debate on whether （题干主题句）. From my perspective, （选择什么的句子）and I believe that （题干主题句改写的立场句）.

Although potentially negative/positive impacts of （题干主题词）should be taken into account, which means 【反对方论点句 1】, I still reckon that （题干主题词）has/have, in many ways, enormously enriched/harmed our lives. For instance, a well-known American scientist/sociaist once said that 【支持方论点句 2】. Moreover, 【支持方论点句 3】. Therefore, we must xxx.

On the other hand, those who argue against the tendency of （题干主题词）hold a different opinion. In the first place, it can be claimed that 【反对方论点句 2】. In the second place, as far as schools/governments/society are concerned, the ultimate aim of schools/governments is to maintain and promote the well-being of society （或者）shape young people into responsible people in the future. As a result, local governments and international organizations should make a joint effort to make sure that this situation will develop in the right direction.

In conclusion, while there are many strong arguments on both sides, I still firmly believe that .I do hope this essay can provide them with some sights
```

there are numerous solid reasons why xxx .

No body can deny the simple fact that xxx.

It should be also emphasized that xxx

I strongly believe that.

For instance, a well-known American scientist/sociaist once said that

感觉RA、RS、DI都在60%以上就可以做到。

RA分低的原因：没找好一句话。迅速找到好说的一句话练习就好
